For example:\n","square loss l(f(xi|θ),yi)=(f(xi|θ)−yi)2, used in linear regression\n","hinge loss l(f(xi|θ),yi)=max(0,1−f(xi|θ)yi), used in SVM\n","0/1 loss l(f(xi|θ),yi)=1⟺f(xi|θ)≠yi, used in theoretical analysis and definition of accuracy\n","**Cost function** is usually more general. It might be a sum of loss functions over your training set plus some model complexity penalty (regularization). For example:\n","Mean Squared Error MSE(θ)=1N∑Ni=1(f(xi|θ)−yi)2\n","SVM cost function SVM(θ)=∥θ∥2+C∑Ni=1ξi (there are additional constraints connecting ξi with C and with training set)\n","**Objective function** is the most general term for any function that you optimize during training. For example, a probability of generating training set in maximum likelihood approach is a well defined objective function, but it is not a loss function nor cost function (however you could define an equivalent cost function). For example:\n","MLE is a type of objective function (which you maximize)\n","Divergence between classes can be an objective function but it is barely a cost function, unless you define something artificial, like 1-Divergence, and name it a cost\n","Long story short, I would say that:\n","\n","A loss function is a part of a cost function which is a type of an objective function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ptcgDnJk_k4X"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
